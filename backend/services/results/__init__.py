"""Results service modular package (scaffolding phase).

Structure:
- repositories.py: DB access abstractions for results/personas/sessions
- services.py: domain services for querying/formatting
- presenters.py: serializers/adapters to API response shapes
- facade.py: thin wrapper preserving legacy ResultsService API during migration
