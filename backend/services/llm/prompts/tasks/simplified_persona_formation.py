TASK: Analyze the provided interview content and create a comprehensive SimplifiedPersona for the {role} with industry-specific insights.

INDUSTRY CONTEXT: {industry.upper()}
{industry_guidance}

INTERVIEW CONTENT:
{text_sample}

ANALYSIS APPROACH:
1. Extract specific demographic details, professional background, and experience level
2. Identify core goals, motivations, and what drives this person professionally
3. Understand their main challenges, frustrations, and pain points
4. Document their skills, expertise, and professional capabilities
5. Note their technology usage patterns, tools, and preferences
6. Capture their workflow style, work environment, and collaboration patterns
7. Understand their needs, expectations, and what they value
8. Extract 3-5 authentic quotes that represent their voice and concerns
9. Apply {industry.upper()} industry-specific context and insights

QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Use specific, detailed information from the interview content
- Avoid generic placeholders - extract real insights
- Set confidence scores based on evidence strength (aim for 80-95% for clear evidence)
- Ensure the persona feels like a real, authentic person
- Include actual quotes, not paraphrases
- Focus on the {role} specifically mentioned in the content
- Apply {industry.upper()} industry context and terminology

SIMPLIFIED PERSONA FORMAT:
Generate a JSON object with these simple string fields (NOT nested objects):

{{

  "name": "Descriptive persona name (e.g., 'Sarah, The Strategic {industry} Balancer')",
  "description": "Brief persona overview summarizing key characteristics in {industry} context",
  "archetype": "Persona category relevant to {industry} (e.g., '{industry}-Focused Strategist')",

  "demographics": "Age, background, experience level, location, {industry} industry details",
  "goals_motivations": "What drives this person, their primary objectives and aspirations in {industry}",
  "challenges_frustrations": "Specific challenges, obstacles, and sources of frustration in {industry}",
  "skills_expertise": "Professional skills, competencies, areas of knowledge and {industry} expertise",
  "technology_tools": "Technology usage patterns, specific tools used, tech relationship in {industry}",
  "pain_points": "Specific problems and issues they experience regularly in {industry}",

  "challenges_confidence": 0.88,
  "skills_confidence": 0.92,
  "technology_confidence": 0.94,
  "pain_points_confidence": 0.87
}}

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Use specific details from the interview content, never generic placeholders
2. Extract real quotes for key_quotes field (3-5 actual quotes from the text)
3. Set confidence scores based on evidence strength (0.8-0.95 for clear evidence)
4. Make personas feel like real, specific people with authentic details
5. Focus on creating rich, detailed content for each field
6. All fields should be simple strings or arrays, NOT nested objects
7. Apply {industry.upper()} industry-specific context throughout

OUTPUT: Complete SimplifiedPersona JSON object with all fields populated using actual evidence from the interview content and {industry} industry context."""
