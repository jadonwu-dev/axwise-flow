        IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
        - AVOID REDUNDANCY: Ensure each insight covers a distinct topic with no overlap or duplication between insights
        - DISTINCT TOPICS: Each insight must focus on a completely different aspect of user experience or need
        - BALANCED PRIORITIES: Distribute priorities evenly - approximately 20% High, 50% Medium, and 30% Low
        - UNIQUE EVIDENCE: Use different evidence quotes for each insight - never reuse the same quote across multiple insights
        - SPECIFIC CRITERIA FOR PRIORITIES:
          * High: Critical issues directly impacting core user workflows with strong evidence
          * Medium: Important issues affecting user experience but with workarounds available
          * Low: Minor issues or opportunities for future improvement
        - Ensure insights are specific and actionable, not generic observations
        - Recommendations should be concrete, implementable, and appropriate for the {industry.upper()} industry
        - Implications should clearly explain why the insight matters to users or organizations in the {industry.upper()} sector
        - Use direct quotes from the text as evidence whenever possible
