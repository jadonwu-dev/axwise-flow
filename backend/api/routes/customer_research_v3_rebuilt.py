V3 Customer Research Service - Rebuilt with V1 Reliability

📚 IMPLEMENTATION REFERENCE: See docs/pydantic-instructor-implementation-guide.md
   for proper Pydantic Instructor usage, JSON parsing, and structured output handling.

Architecture:
- V1 Core (100% reliable foundation)
- V3 Enhancement Layers (fail-safe additions)
- Circuit breaker pattern for unreliable enhancements
- Always fall back to working V1 behavior

Philosophy: Never replace what works, only enhance it safely.

- Conversation Stage: {conversation_stage}

RECENT CONVERSATION:
{recent_conversation}

LATEST ASSISTANT MESSAGE:
{assistant_response}

CRITICAL CONTEXT ANALYSIS:
- Assistant expecting confirmation: {assistant_expecting_confirmation}

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Generate 4-5 quick reply options that match what the assistant is expecting from the user
2. If assistant is asking for confirmation, provide confirmation responses
3. If assistant is asking for information, provide information responses
4. Use natural, conversational language that feels like helpful user responses
5. Avoid generic options like "Okay", "Sounds good" unless they make contextual sense

CONVERSATION FLOW LOGIC:
- If assistant asks for CONFIRMATION: User should respond with confirmation/clarification options
  Examples: "Yes, that's correct", "Generate the questions", "Let me clarify something", "That sounds right"

- If assistant asks for INFORMATION: User should provide business information or ask for guidance
  Examples: "It's a mobile app for busy professionals", "The main challenge is...", "Tell me more about that"

- If assistant asks OPEN QUESTIONS: User should provide specific business details
  Examples: Business model details, target customer specifics, problem descriptions

BUSINESS-AWARE CONTENT (only when assistant is asking for information):
- For gaming/entertainment businesses: Focus on community, engagement, monetization
- For healthcare businesses: Focus on compliance, patient outcomes, provider workflows
- For e-commerce businesses: Focus on customer acquisition, conversion, logistics
- For SaaS/tech businesses: Focus on user adoption, integration, scalability

Return ONLY a JSON array of 4-5 suggestion strings:
["suggestion 1", "suggestion 2", "suggestion 3", "suggestion 4", "suggestion 5"]

IMPORTANT: Match the suggestions to what the assistant is actually asking for, not what the user might want to ask back.

CRITICAL BUSINESS READINESS CRITERIA (be conservative):
1. Business idea must be clearly articulated (not just vague concepts)
2. Target customer must be specific (not just "people" or "users")
3. Customer PROBLEM must be explicitly stated (not just business features)
4. Conversation must have sufficient depth (at least 3-4 meaningful exchanges)
5. User must show readiness to move forward (not still exploring/clarifying)

PROBLEM CONTEXT REQUIREMENTS:
- Must identify specific customer pain points or frustrations
- Must explain WHY customers need this solution
- Business features alone are NOT sufficient - need underlying customer problems
- Be conservative: only mark ready if problem context is clearly articulated

USER CONFIRMATION DETECTION:
- Look for explicit agreement: "Yes, that's correct", "That's right", "Generate questions"
- Distinguish from continuation: providing more details, clarifying, adding information
- Only mark as confirmation if user explicitly agrees to proceed"""

STAKEHOLDER:

Description: {stakeholder_description}

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR STAKEHOLDER TYPE:

If stakeholder_type is "primary":
- These are DIRECT USERS/CUSTOMERS who personally experience the problem
- Use natural, conversational language that feels like a friendly interview
- Questions should focus on their personal experience with the problem
- Ask about their current pain points, frustrations, and needs in a natural way
- Focus on their willingness to pay and use the solution
- Use phrases like "How often do you...", "What would make this valuable to you...", "Tell me about your experience with..."
- Keep questions conversational and approachable, not overly formal

If stakeholder_type is "secondary":
- These are SUPPORTERS/INFLUENCERS who help or influence the primary users
- Questions should focus on their SUPPORT ROLE and INFLUENCE over others
- Ask about how they currently HELP the primary users
- Focus on their willingness to RECOMMEND and SUPPORT the solution for others
- Use phrases like "How do you help...", "Would you recommend...", "What concerns would you have about [others] using...", "How do you support..."
- Reference the primary users as "them", "the [target customer]", or specific names

LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS:
- Primary questions: Use natural, conversational language that feels like a friendly interview
- Secondary questions: Focus on their support role and influence over others
- Make questions professional yet approachable, suitable for user research interviews
- Avoid excessive emphasis on "YOU" - keep it natural and conversational

Return a JSON object with exactly this structure:
{{
    "problemDiscovery": [

        "Question about challenges they face in this area",
        "Question about current solutions they use",
        "Question about pain points and frustrations",
        "Question about their ideal solution"
    ],
    "solutionValidation": [
        "Question about what would make the solution valuable",
        "Question about important features or characteristics",
        "Question about pricing expectations or concerns",

IMPORTANT:
- Make questions sound natural and conversational, like a professional user researcher would ask
- Primary questions should focus on personal experience in a natural way
- Secondary questions should focus on their support/influence role naturally
- Reference the actual business idea, target customer, and problems contextually
- Use the stakeholder's specific name and description appropriately

Consider these factors:
1. SIMPLE LOCAL SERVICES targeting INDIVIDUALS typically need only ONE stakeholder group:
   - Examples: Photography for individuals, haircuts, personal training, tutoring, massage therapy
   - These serve individual consumers directly with no complex decision-making process

2. COMPLEX BUSINESSES typically need MULTIPLE stakeholder groups:
   - B2B services (multiple decision makers in companies)
   - Platforms/marketplaces (buyers AND sellers)
   - Healthcare (patients AND providers AND administrators)
   - Technology solutions (end users AND IT decision makers)

3. AVOID RIDICULOUS STAKEHOLDERS:
   - Don't suggest interviewing large platforms/companies (like "Tinder Platform", "Facebook", "Google")
   - Don't suggest stakeholders you can't realistically interview
   - Focus on people/groups you can actually talk to

Instructions:
1. Identify PRIMARY stakeholders: The main target customers/users who will directly use the product/service
2. Identify SECONDARY stakeholders: Supporting people, partners, or influencers who affect or are affected by this business
3. Base stakeholders on the ACTUAL business context provided, not generic templates

Guidelines:
- For specialty businesses (like gaming cafes), include both the service aspect (coffee customers) AND the specialty aspect (gaming community)
- For technology businesses, consider both end users and technical decision makers
- For healthcare businesses, consider patients, providers, and administrators
- For retail businesses, consider customers, suppliers, and local business community
- Always make stakeholder names and descriptions specific to the actual business described

Provide specific, meaningful stakeholder names and detailed descriptions based on the actual business context.
