    --- Interview with Anja, Legal Document Analyst ---

    Researcher: What are your main concerns about implementing AI in document analysis?

    Anja: In the legal field, there's zero room for error. My absolute top concern is accuracy. We handle everything from complex commercial contracts to litigation discovery documents, and the biggest fear, always, is missing something critical – a specific clause, a deadline, a liability detail. Data security and privacy are paramount for any new AI solution, especially concerning GDPR compliance and preventing data leakage.

    Researcher: How much time do you currently spend on manual document processing?

    Anja: Easily, 60 to 70 percent of my week is dedicated to just reviewing, extracting, or analyzing these documents. It's incredibly repetitive. The biggest pain point, by far, is the sheer tedium and the time it consumes. It's time that isn't directly billable, which is the frustrating part.

    Researcher: What would you prefer to focus on instead?

    Anja: My first priority would be to dive deeper into the actual legal strategy of cases rather than getting bogged down in document processing. I'd want to shift my role from a document processor to a true legal strategist and advisor. I'd also spend more time directly with clients, understanding their needs and providing strategic guidance.

    --- Interview with Max, Audit Specialist ---

    Researcher: What challenges do you face in your current audit work?

    Max: I'd say easily 60 to 70 percent of my time is just spent sifting through documents, cross-referencing data, and ensuring compliance. Definitely tedium, first and foremost. The biggest bottleneck is cross-referencing – making sure that financial data aligns across multiple documents and systems.

    Researcher: What are your concerns about AI implementation?

    Max: Accuracy is non-negotiable. In auditing, even small discrepancies can have massive implications. I need to be confident that any AI solution can maintain the same level of precision that I would achieve manually, if not better.

    --- Interview with Senior Partner ---

    Researcher: What factors drive your technology adoption decisions?

    Senior Partner: They're the ones who control the budget and set the strategic direction. He's very focused on efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Mr. Schmidt's main priority would be to see a clear ROI – how this technology will either save money, generate more revenue, or improve client satisfaction.
