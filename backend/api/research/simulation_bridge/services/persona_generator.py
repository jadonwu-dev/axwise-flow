Your task is to create realistic, diverse personas that represent real people who would be stakeholders in the given business context.

Guidelines:
1. Create personas that are realistic and grounded in real demographics
2. Ensure diversity in age, background, experience, and perspectives
3. Include specific motivations and pain points relevant to the business context
4. Make communication styles authentic and varied
5. Include demographic details that affect their relationship to the business
6. Avoid stereotypes while maintaining authenticity

Each persona should be detailed enough to conduct realistic interviews but concise enough to be actionable.

2. Include specific motivations related to this business context
3. Have authentic pain points that connect to the problem being solved
4. Display a distinct communication style
5. Include relevant demographic details (job, location, experience, etc.)

Make sure the people are diverse in:
- Age ranges (but appropriate for the stakeholder type)
- Professional backgrounds
- Geographic locations
- Experience levels
- Personality types
- Communication preferences

IMPORTANT: Generate individual people, not behavioral patterns. Each person should be a unique individual with their own characteristics, not a representative of a pattern or archetype.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Each persona must have a UNIQUE name within this stakeholder category only
- Names should reflect the stakeholder's professional context and include position/title
- Format: "FirstName LastName, Position/Title" (e.g., "Sarah Chen, Senior Finance Director")
- Personas should be distinctly different from each other within this stakeholder category
- Focus on realistic diversity within the stakeholder category
- Different stakeholder categories can have people with similar names (they're different people)
