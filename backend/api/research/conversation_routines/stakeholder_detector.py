Business Context:
- Business Idea: {business_idea}
- Target Customer: {target_customer}
- Problem Being Solved: {problem}
- Primary Business Location: {location or "Not specified"}

Recent Conversation:
{conversation_text}

Location & geography guidelines:
- Treat the primary business location as the main geographic anchor for this business.
- The clear majority of key stakeholders should be based in or near this region (same city/region/country where it makes sense).
- A minority of stakeholders can be in other locations, but only when it clearly makes business sense (e.g., another office of the same company, an important regional customer or partner, or a key supplier site).
- Make each stakeholder's location plausible and obviously connected to the business context.
- Avoid stakeholders whose primary location is clearly unrelated to this region unless the business idea explicitly mentions operations there.
- When you mention institutions, labor practices, or regulations, align them with the appropriate region for each stakeholder's location without inventing unrealistic culture-specific details.

Identify specific stakeholders (not generic roles):

1. PRIMARY stakeholders (2-3 max):
   - Direct users who would actually use the solution
   - People who experience the problem firsthand
   - Decision makers for purchasing/adoption

2. SECONDARY stakeholders (1-2 max):
   - People who influence decisions but may not use directly
   - People affected by the solution indirectly
   - Gatekeepers or advisors

For each stakeholder, provide:
- name: Specific, descriptive name (not "Primary User")
- description: Brief description of their role and relationship to the business

Return as JSON:
{{
  "primary": [
    {{"name": "Busy Office Workers", "description": "Professionals who need quick coffee between meetings"}},
    ...

  "secondary": [
    {{"name": "Office Managers", "description": "People who decide on office amenities and vendor relationships"}},
    ...
  ]
}}

Make stakeholder names specific to this business context and consistent with these location guidelines."""

Location & geography guidelines:
- Treat the primary business location as the main geographic anchor for this research project.
- Assume that most stakeholders are based in or near this primary region.
- If this specific stakeholder is imagined in a different city or country, their location must be clearly and realistically connected to the primary business location (e.g., another office, a key customer region, a supplier/manufacturing site, or an important partner).
- Avoid placing this stakeholder in a clearly unrelated region unless the business idea explicitly mentions operations there.
- When you mention institutions, labor practices, or regulations in questions, align them with the appropriate region for the stakeholder's location without hard-coding culture-specific details.

Generate questions in these categories:

1. PROBLEM DISCOVERY ({problem_count} questions):
   - Questions to understand their current state and pain points
   - Focus on their specific challenges related to {business_idea}

2. SOLUTION VALIDATION ({solution_count} questions):
   - Questions to validate your proposed solution approach
   - Focus on their interest, concerns, and requirements

3. FOLLOW-UP ({followup_count} questions):
   - Questions for deeper insights and next steps
   - Questions about decision-making and influences

Make all questions highly specific to {stakeholder_name} and their role.
