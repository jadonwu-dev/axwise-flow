### ⚠️ **Important: Primary Objective First**
**Start with your primary stakeholder research to validate core assumptions, then expand to secondary stakeholders to refine and validate your approach.**

---

## **Phase 1: Primary Stakeholders (Week 1-2)**
### 🏢 **Target: 5-7 Primary Stakeholders**

#### **🔍 Problem Discovery Questions:**
1. "Walk me through your current process for handling this challenge."
2. "What's the most frustrating part of your current workflow?"
3. "How much time do you spend each day on this type of task?"
4. "What happens when the current process doesn't work as expected?"
5. "How do you currently handle communication around this issue?"

#### **✅ Solution Validation Questions:**
1. "Would a solution that addresses this problem be valuable to your organization?"
2. "What features would be most important in an ideal solution?"
3. "How much would you be willing to invest in a solution that significantly improves this process?"
4. "What concerns would you have about implementing a new system?"
5. "How do you typically evaluate new solutions in this area?"

#### **💡 Follow-up Questions:**
1. "Who else would be involved in the decision to adopt this type of solution?"
2. "What integration requirements would you have with existing systems?"
3. "How would you measure the success of this type of solution?"

---

## **Phase 2: Secondary Stakeholders (Week 3)**

### 👥 **Secondary Users (5-6 interviews)**

#### **🔍 Problem Discovery Questions:**
1. "Describe your last experience with this type of process."
2. "What's most frustrating about the current approach?"
3. "How do you prefer to interact with this type of system?"
4. "What information do you need to feel confident using a solution?"
5. "How important is ease of use in this context?"

#### **✅ Solution Validation Questions:**
1. "Would you be interested in a solution that simplifies this process?"
2. "What features would be most important to you?"
3. "How much would convenience influence your choice to use this solution?"
4. "What concerns would you have about using a new system?"
5. "How do you currently make decisions in this area?"

---

## **Phase 3: Cross-Stakeholder Validation (Week 4)**

### 🔄 **Synthesis Questions for All Groups:**
1. "Based on what we've learned, does this approach address your main concerns?"
2. "What potential conflicts do you see between different user needs?"
3. "How would you prioritize these features: [list top features from all groups]?"

### 📊 **Expected Deliverables:**
- **Primary Stakeholder Requirements** (workflow needs, pricing expectations)
- **User Experience Guidelines** (preferences, communication channels, trust factors)
- **Feature Priority Matrix** (ranked by stakeholder impact and business value)
- **Go-to-Market Strategy** (tailored messaging for each stakeholder group)

### 🎯 **Success Metrics:**
- **Primary stakeholder adoption criteria** clearly defined
- **User acceptance requirements** validated
- **Pricing strategy** validated across all groups
- **Technical requirements** prioritized by stakeholder value

**This complete questionnaire ensures you gather actionable insights from all stakeholders while maintaining focus on your primary business objectives.**`,

### ⚠️ **Important: Primary Objective First**
**Start with your primary stakeholder research to validate core assumptions, then expand to secondary stakeholders to refine and validate your approach.**

---

## **Phase 1: Primary Stakeholders (Week 1-2)**
### 🏢 **Target: 5-7 Primary Stakeholders**

${primaryStakeholders.map((stakeholder, index) => `
### ${index + 1}. ${stakeholder.name}
*${stakeholder.description}*

#### **🔍 Problem Discovery Questions:**
${stakeholder.questions.discovery.map((q, i) => `${i + 1}. "${q}"`).join('\n')}

#### **✅ Solution Validation Questions:**
${stakeholder.questions.validation.map((q, i) => `${i + 1}. "${q}"`).join('\n')}

#### **💡 Follow-up Questions:**
${stakeholder.questions.followUp.map((q, i) => `${i + 1}. "${q}"`).join('\n')}
`).join('\n---\n')}

---

## **Phase 2: Secondary Stakeholders (Week 3)**
### 👥 **Secondary Users (5-6 interviews)**

${secondaryStakeholders.length > 0 ? secondaryStakeholders.map((stakeholder, index) => `
### ${index + 1}. ${stakeholder.name}
*${stakeholder.description}*

#### **🔍 Problem Discovery Questions:**
${stakeholder.questions.discovery.map((q, i) => `${i + 1}. "${q}"`).join('\n')}

#### **✅ Solution Validation Questions:**
${stakeholder.questions.validation.map((q, i) => `${i + 1}. "${q}"`).join('\n')}

#### **💡 Follow-up Questions:**
${stakeholder.questions.followUp.map((q, i) => `${i + 1}. "${q}"`).join('\n')}
`).join('\n---\n') : '*No secondary stakeholders detected for this business model.*'}

---

## **Phase 3: Cross-Stakeholder Validation (Week 4)**

### 🔄 **Synthesis Questions for All Groups:**
1. "Based on what we've learned, does this approach address your main concerns?"
2. "What potential conflicts do you see between different user needs?"
3. "How would you prioritize these features: [list top features from all groups]?"

### 📊 **Expected Deliverables:**
- **Primary Stakeholder Requirements** (workflow needs, pricing expectations)
- **User Experience Guidelines** (preferences, communication channels, trust factors)
- **Feature Priority Matrix** (ranked by stakeholder impact and business value)
- **Go-to-Market Strategy** (tailored messaging for each stakeholder group)

### 🎯 **Success Metrics:**
- **Primary stakeholder adoption criteria** clearly defined
- **User acceptance requirements** validated
- **Pricing strategy** validated across all groups
- **Technical requirements** prioritized by stakeholder value

**This complete questionnaire ensures you gather actionable insights from all stakeholders while maintaining focus on your primary business objectives.**`;
